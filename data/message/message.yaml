title: "Dear Colleagues and Friends"
message: "We are pleased to announce that the Thematic Conference on Forensic Psychiatry and Prison Psychiatry between Medicine and Law will be held in /Ohrid, North Macedonia/, on 15 - 18 October, 2026. This long-anticipated event aims to unite professionals from psychiatry, psychology, law, and criminology in a multidisciplinary dialogue at the crossroads \"where justice meets the human mind.\"\n

Over the past years, forensic psychiatry has evolved as a field of growing importance, standing at the delicate intersection between mental health and the legal system. Through lectures, panel discussions, and case-based sessions, this conference will explore the complexity of psychiatric expertise in legal contexts, ethical dilemmas, assessment of criminal responsibility, risk evaluation, and the treatment of offenders with mental disorders.\n

Our vision is to create a platform where science, ethics, and justice converge: a space where knowledge and clinical experience meet judicial principles, where experts share their insight, and where young professionals are inspired to contribute to the advancement of forensic mental health. The conference will serve as a laboratory for critical thought, collaboration, and the establishment of professional networks across the region and beyond.\n

And of course, the setting of Ohrid, with its timeless beauty and tranquil lake, will add a special note to our gathering. This UNESCO-protected city - rich in history and spirit, offers the perfect atmosphere for reflection, dialogue, and connection. We cannot promise that the serenity of the lake will resolve all forensic dilemmas, but it will certainly offer the right background for inspiration.\n

On behalf of the organizing committee, we warmly invite you to join us in Ohrid and take part in this unique event that bridges law and psychiatry.\n

We look forward to seeing you next autumn!"
